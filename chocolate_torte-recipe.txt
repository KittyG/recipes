CHOCOLATE TORTE

AN INDULGENT DESSERT FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

CHOCOLATE SPONGE:
3 medium eggs
75g (3oz) caster sugar
65g (21/2oz) plain flour
15g (1/2oz) cocoa powder

CHOCOLATE TOPPING:
3 gelatine leaves
30ml (1fl oz) glucose
(available from pharmacists)
60ml (2fl oz) water
250g (9oz) dark chocolate, melted
300ml (1/2 pint) double cream
Icing sugar, to decorate
Tuille biscuits, to serve

Preheat the oven to 200ºC, fan oven 180ºC, Gas Mark 6. 

Grease and line with non-stick baking paper a Swiss roll tin measuring approximately 32 x 23cm (13 x 9 inches). 
Use a hand-held electric mixer to whisk the eggs and sugar together until very thick and foamy – this will take about 5 minutes. 
The mixture should be thick enough to leave a trail on the surface when the beaters are lifted. 
Sift the flour and cocoa powder together, then fold them gently into the egg mixture using a large metal spoon. 
Tip into the prepared tin, spreading out evenly. Bake for 6-7 minutes. 
Cool for a few minutes, then turn out onto a work surface and remove the lining paper. 
Use a 7.5cm (3 inch) plain cutter to stamp out 8 circles. 
Place 8 x 7.5cm (3 inch) ring moulds or ramekins on a tray, then place the chocolate sponge circles in their bases.

For the topping, soak the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes. 
Put the glucose into a saucepan and add the water. 
Slowly bring to the boil, then remove from the heat. 
Squeeze the water from the gelatine, then add the gelatine to the glucose mixture and stir to dissolve. 
Slowly stir the gelatine mixture into the melted chocolate. 
Whip the cream until thickened, but not stiff, then fold into the chocolate mixture. 
Spoon over the chocolate bases and refrigerate until set. 
Serve, decorated with a little icing sugar and the tuille biscuits.

Serves 8
